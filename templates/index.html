            The application serves as a tool for oncologists and other specialists/physicians in the early diagnosis of tumors and cancers. Leveraging advanced algorithms and medical data analysis, it assists healthcare professionals in identifying and diagnosing malignancies at their nascent stages. It plays a pivotal role in enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatment strategies and contributing to better patient care. Its integration into clinical workflows underscores its significance as a valuable resource in the fight against cancer.

            The application accommodates both MRI and CT images as input, offering flexibility to users. While providing both types of images can enhance output accuracy significantly, it's not mandatory. The software can generate accurate results even with individual images. This adaptability ensures usability across various medical imaging modalities, allowing healthcare professionals to utilize the application effectively in their diagnostic processes. The option to input either MRI or CT images separately underscores the application's versatility and commitment to delivering reliable diagnostic outcomes for brain tumors and cancer.
